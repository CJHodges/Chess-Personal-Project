# Chess Personal Project
This is a solo personal project done by Callum John Hodges, the project has an end goal, but some extension goals may be added. 

There is no clear deadline for this project, and all work on the project shall be documented.
***

# Goal of the Project:
 The goal of this project is to make a working chessboard that only allows legal moves and ends the game when someone is in check.

# Scope of the project:
This project will be considered a success if i am able to successfully create the logic for a chessboard, chess pieces, game logic and then successfully integrate them all using javafx.

# What I Intend to Learn:
I intend to learn how to use javafx, I have never used javafx so i will need to learn how to use it and how to integrate the back-end/ logic of the game with javafx

# Documentation of the project:
There will be minimal documentation of the project. I plan to document changes made to the code using git commits and i plan to document the total amount of hours spent on the project by adding blogs that contain what was done.
